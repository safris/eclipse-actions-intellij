## Eclipse Actions

> **for Intellij IDEA**

1. <ins>Quick Find Next</ins> and <ins>Quick Find Previous</ins>

   A one-keystroke way to navigate to the next/previous occurrence of selected text (just like in Eclipse).

   Same as IntelliJ's default <ins>Find Next Occurrence</ins> and <ins>Find Previous Occurrence</ins>, but also:
   1. <b>Slurps the selected text</b> as the string to find, like in Eclipse.
   1. <b>Does away with the annoying "Not found" tooltip</b>, like in Eclipse.

1. <ins>Select Next Error</ins> and <ins>Select Previous Error</ins>

   Same as IntelliJ's default <ins>Goto Next Error</ins> and <ins>Goto Previous Error</ins>, but also:
   1. <b>Selects the error</b>, like in Eclipse.

1. <ins>Select Super Method</ins>

   Same as IntelliJ's default <ins>Go to Super Method</ins>, but also:
   1. <b>Selects the method identifier</b>, like in Eclipse.

1. <ins>Select Declaration</ins>

   Same as IntelliJ's default <ins>Go to Declaration or Usages</ins>, but also:
   1. <b>Selects the method identifier</b>, like in Eclipse.

When assigning your keys or mouse shortcuts, ensure that shortcuts are not mapped to other actions in the Keymap settings.
